## My process
* I first structured my content using html
* then styled it using css
* I made used of flex box instead of table for the nutrition content
* and also, I amd use of helper class for margin bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt more about css flex box, flex 1, taking the max width and about media query and I believe as I move on, I will perfect my media query skills.


### Continued development

I want to practice more, makebeautiful sites with all I have learnt so, I need to focus on Flex, Grid, animations, media query and Js
